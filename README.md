### White Box AKA Chalkboard:
-> This is the space where you can View/Select the web design you will be developing.<br />
-> To select an element from the "chalkboard" you just need to click down that element. After that, the selected element will show it's border color style as green.

### Bottom Left Box:
-> 1 - Elements list: This is the list where you can find the Elements you can add into the "chalkboard". For adding an element to the "chalkboard" or inside an element already present into the "chalkboard" slide the button with the title of the element you want to add from the Elements List to inside the chalkboard and release the click.<br />
-> 2 - Delete Button: This will delete the element you had selected from the "chalkboard" previously (At this moment, this DK don't have an "Undo button", so take care of what you are deleting).<br />

### Bottom Center Box:
-> ClassNames of the selected element: This is where you can view and edit the ClassNames of the element you had selected previously (Warning: Please *DON'T DELETE THE "SELECTED" OR "DEFAULTDIV" CLASSNAME FROM THE SELECTED ELEMENT*).<br />
-> By default every "Div" element created have a "DefaultDiv" classname, that exist to show easily the element inside the "chalkboard". If you want to disable the "DEFAULTDIV" properties goto the *left lateral Stylerule Creator / Editor bar* section of this document.<br />
